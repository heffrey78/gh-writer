# @gh-writer/web

The gh-writer app: what the author sees in the browser. `gh-writer serve` serves its build (`dist/`) from the local server ([packages/server](../server/README.md)), at every path outside `/api`.

```sh
npm run build              # build the app (gh-writer serve serves dist/)
npm run dev                # Vite on http://localhost:5180, with a real gh-writer server inside
npm run test:e2e -w @gh-writer/web   # build, then Playwright against real servers
```

## Structure

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/main.tsx` | Routes: `/` the library, `/novels/:novelId/*` a novel's workspace |
| `src/layout.tsx` | The frame: skip link, top bar, theme choice |
| `src/library/` | The library page: novels, open a folder, clone from GitHub |
| `src/novel/` | A novel's workspace |
| `src/ui/` | Shared controls (button, field, alert, confirmation dialog), in the shadcn/ui manner |
| `src/api.ts` | The `@gh-writer/client` API on the page's origin, and the TanStack Query client and keys |
| `e2e/` | Playwright tests; `fixtures.ts` starts `gh-writer serve` for each test |

Server state goes through TanStack Query, UI state through Zustand. Components are Radix primitives (via `radix-ui`) styled with Tailwind.

## Theming

One palette for the app and the editor. The editor's stylesheet defines the `--ghw-*` custom properties (ink, paper, muted, accent, rule…) for light and dark, and `src/styles.css` adds the app's few (panel, raised, danger, ok, warn) in the same three places: the light defaults, the `prefers-color-scheme: dark` block, and `[data-theme="dark"]`. Tailwind's theme maps onto them (`bg-paper`, `text-muted`, `border-rule`…), so every utility follows the theme and there are no `dark:` variants.

The theme follows the OS. Choosing Light or Dark in the top bar sets `data-theme` on the root element and keeps the choice in this browser's local storage.

## Dev loop

`npm run dev` starts Vite with a plugin that runs a gh-writer server in the same process, using the author's library (or `GH_WRITER_CONFIG_DIR`'s). The plugin proxies `/api` to it, with the session cookie attached. Host and Origin are rewritten to the server's own, so its security checks run as in production. Open http://localhost:5180; there's no token to copy. That convenience is the catch: any request to the dev server's `/api` gets the session, so keep `npm run dev` for development. Vite listens on localhost only, and its own host check stays on.

## Security

The server answers the page only with its session cookie (see the server's security model). It serves the page with a Content Security Policy allowing only its own scripts, styles, workers and connections (`CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` in the server). Hashed files under `/assets/` are cached for good, and `index.html` is never cached.

## Tests

`e2e/fixtures.ts` gives each test a temporary home: its own git identity, config folder (library.json) and clone folder. It starts `gh-writer serve --no-open` there and reads the launch URL from its output. The library tests cover:

- the token exchange
- opening a folder by keyboard
- cloning from a local bare repository
- the guidance for refused credentials (an HTTP remote answering 401)
- notices for folders that have gone
- removing with confirmation
- theme choice
- an axe audit, empty and with novels, in light and dark
